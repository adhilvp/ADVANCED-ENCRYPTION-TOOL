**MENTOR NAME**: NEELA SANTHOSH

**DESCRIPTION**: The Advanced Encryption Tool is a Python-based application that provides secure encryption and decryption of files using the AES-256 algorithm. Built with a user-friendly graphical interface using the Tkinter library, this tool ensures robust data protection by employing the PyCryptodome library for encryption. The tool generates a unique 256-bit encryption key and initialization vector (IV) for each operation, ensuring high security. Users can easily select files for encryption, which are saved with a ".enc" extension, and decrypt them back to their original form. The tool handles file input/output operations, encrypting file contents securely, and storing the encrypted data efficiently. The decrypted files are restored with their original names, maintaining data integrity. This project is essential for safeguarding sensitive data, offering a simple yet powerful solution for encryption tasks. The code is modular and well-documented, making it easy for developers to understand and extend its functionality. Libraries like Tkinter and PyCryptodome form the backbone of this tool, while additional utilities from the OS and filedialog modules assist in seamless file operations. This project demonstrates the importance of encryption in cybersecurity, ensuring data remains confidential and protected from unauthorized access.
